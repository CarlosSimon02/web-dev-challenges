## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is quite a long time since I had a front end challenge, this project helped me recall some of the things but I am still on the stage of remembering them.   

### Continued development

It is not enough to just know all the properties in css and html, but also, it is vital to know when and where I should use them. I should also go dive deeper to their mechanisms because there are times that it showed unexpected behaviour just like what happened in this project.
